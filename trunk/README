For this assignment, you should your ee462xxx account and
quatro01.ecn.purdue.edu or quatro02.ecn.purdue.edu.  Each machine has
32 cores.  These machines are donated by Intel in 2010.

============= How to Run ====================

./runtest

This will generate two matrices, each 1024 x 1024.  The results
are stored in file m3.

It takes 11.307 s to perform matrix computation (in one specific
instance)

For 4096 x 4096, the multiplication takes 1014.671s.

============= MATLAB ====================

Your program's performance is evaluated by comparing with
MATLAB.

If you execute MATLAB remotely, you can use 

matlab -nodisplay 

and it will not open a window.  This can be much faster.

Suppose the two source matrices are m1 and m2.  In MATLAB

>> load('m1');
>> load('m2');
>> load('m3');

To measure the time spent in MATLAB

>> tic; m4 = m1 * m2; toc      

The two matrices m1 and m2 must be large enough to get meaningful
time measurement.

How to use MATLAB to check correctness?

>> max(max(abs(m3 - m4)))

If the result is zero, your program produces correct results.

It takes MATLAB 0.106 second to compute m4 (1024 x 1024)

For 4096 x 4096, the multiplication takes 0.783 s.
